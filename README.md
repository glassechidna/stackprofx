## stackprofx

Stackprofx is a fork of the sampling call-stack profiler for Ruby 2.1+,
[`stackprof`][1]. It exists only because the fork's author wanted to
make some terrible changes to the upstream project that no maintainer
should accept.

### Why "x"?

I was considering calling it stackprof2, but 2 implies a successor to 1
and this is in no way "better" than the original project.
